# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning
This project intended to explore diferent machine learning models to classify pollen data. We replicated the project on https://github.com/Betelgesse/PredictiveBiomeModelling
by running each model with the parameters stated on the paper.

In the complete folder there are some descriptive analysis about how unbalanced the data is. That instigated us into appliying SMOTE into the original paper. 

The results are in the pdf.
